          I am a Fullstack Developer, Software Designer, and Artist currently

            "What is with all these shiny donuts? And there is hardly any
            styling on this whole page? This dumb menu is in my way too! You
            said you were a designer. This looks terrible!"

          The short answer is because I think it is <strong>funny</strong> and I
          love J Dilla. Also, there are a lot of benefits to making a site
          really boring. For instance, without a ton of styling and content
          everywhere, my site is inherently responsive. Go ahead, resize the
          window!
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <h3>"OOOOOOOOOOO! It is so responsive!"</h3> <br />-{' '}
          <strong>You</strong> (probably again...)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Not to mention. Not <i>reeaally</i> designing my site leaves me free
          to do a whole lot of other cool projects. Like potentially work on{' '}
          <strong>YOUR</strong> project! That is right people!{' '}
          <strong>I am available for hire.</strong> Play your cards right and
          you could have your own site as good as this one. But probably a lot
          better because I am actually pretty good at my job (despite your first
          impression). If you don't believe me, take a look at this!

        <p>You're right. Got a little carried away.</p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, most of my most recent and compelling work is behind a
          big IBM firewall and an NDA. So it makes it tough for me to really
          show off all the cools stuff I've been working on.{' '}
          <strong>BUT</strong> if by some strange stretch of the imagination you
          still aren't convinced by my accolades, you can take a look at some of
          the other resources and determine for yourself.
