# Portfolio

This is my portfolio. Built on top of the `Auth-Starter-2.0` package.

# Auth Starter 2.0
Starter repo for user authentication using passport, user payment handling using Stripe, and SSR using Next. Component Library AntD

### Getting Started
1. Change `.env.example` to `.env`, and populate all fields
2. Start database `sudo mongod` (Catalina -- specify config file: `sudo mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`)
3. (OPTIONAL) - start Neo4j database (currently un-used)
4. Start Strapi (in different repo) `strapi start` or `npx strapi start`
5. `$ npm run dev`

### Notes:
  1) `passport-facebook` strategy will not return the Users Facebook URL by default. You must use the Facebook Javascript SDK. This repo does not do that.
  2) Instagram authentication doesn't return user email.
    - Also Instagram authentication is silly and probably shouldnt be done
  3) All login related routes live under `/c/login` route
  4) This uses both SASS and LESS Preprocessors. LESS is used with AntD Design Language and Components found [here](https://ant.design/)
  5) You have to setup a Google app to send emails using nodemailer from google. [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ44WA_eV8E)
  6) Importing all AntD CSS styles in the `main.scss`, this is to avoid `mini-css-extract-plugin` ordering errors described [here](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/15696)
  7) The `CardDetails` component requires passing in `{...props}`
  8) Profile is a Class component. Needs `shouldComponentUpdate` to avoid unnecessary re-renders
    - TODO: find a way to do this with hooks.

### TODO
Todos are kept in the auth-starter-2.0 repo's issues.
You can also search the code base for `TODO:` for small refactors
- [x] Set the HTTP Cookie to Secure
- [x] Check for `Referer` when checking cookie
  - [ ] https://blog.webf.zone/ultimate-guide-to-http-cookies-2aa3e083dbae
- [x] If you try and login while logged in â€” go to profile
- [ ] Convert into MonoRepo - ie seperate out Server and Client
- [ ] Figure out a way to opt in to Automatic Static optimization [url](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/master/errors/opt-out-auto-static-optimization.md)
